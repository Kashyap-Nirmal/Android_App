## Technology stack
- Java

## Tool used
Android Studio

## Introduction
- Worked as an ***Android Intern*** for ***1.5 months***. This was developed as part of the internship at [`Akash Technolabs, Ahmedabad`](https://akashtechnolabs.com/). Learnt and implemented android modules from beginner to intermediate levels.
- This ***native android*** project has implementations of a wide range of android classes and their independent demos.
- There is a main app to launch all these demos.
- Few of these classes are Activity life cycle classes, Google Face Api, SMS Manager, Telephony Manager, Speech to Text and Text To Speech, Services etc.
- [`Report.pdf`](https://github.com/Kashyap-Nirmal/Android_App/blob/main/Report.pdf) is the report of this project.
 
### Duration `May 2019 - Jun 2019`

## Note
- These demo apps were created and tested for ***Android 5 Lolipop***. 
- ***Request app permissions was not available for Android 5***. So if you try to run these demos on ***newer versions of android, demo might crash due to missing permission***. If so happens, ***please manually grant the required permissions***.
- APK files are available for download. Navigate to the app you would like to try. You can use the Table given below. The APK file is available there.
- Some snapshots of the demos are also present along with the apps.
- There are quite a few demos as you might have seen. I was under impression that I would merge all the small-small functionalities of these demo into a single app. But time did not permit it.
- Still it was really ***great learning experience***. I can make a single application using the ***knowledge of all these demos, and the available codes***. I am planning to do it as soon as possible.
